I am a recent master's graduate from [California State University, Northridge (CSUN)](https://www.csun.edu/), where I earned my M.S. in Manufacturing Systems Engineering and B.S. in Mechanical Engineering. I currently work as a Mechanical Engineer at a Bitcoin-related company.

My research interests lie in **Additive Manufacturing (AM)** and **Process Intelligence**. In AM, I focus on generative design, process optimization, and material characterization for laser powder bed fusion systems. My work contributes to developing high-performance superalloys for aerospace and medical applications. For Process Intelligence, I am passionate about building human-centric knowledge systems to enhance learning, decision-making, and operational efficiency in manufacturing.

I have research experience from both the **CSUN NASA-funded Autonomy Research Center for STEAHM (ARCS)** and the **Laboratory for Smart and Additive Manufacturing**. Projects I have worked on include:
- Energy and Appliance Standards for Plug Loads
- WATT (Workers and Technology Together) waste classification system
- LSTM-Transformer-based State Prediction for Sustainable Manufacturing
- Additive Manufacturing of Aerospace Heat Exchangers and Metal Powder Recycling
