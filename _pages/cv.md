Smart & Manufacturing Projects 2022 & 2024
∗ Energy and Appliance Standards for Plug Loads: Assessing Current Needs and Future Opportunities.
Benchmark plug load devices to identify cost-effective energy-saving opportunities, develop reliable test procedures for
quantifying energy use across various operational modes, and analyze test data to model the impact of codes and
standards recommendations on statewide savings and related outcomes.

∗ Workers and Technology Together (WATT). This project focuses on automating waste sorting by using machine
learning to classify different types of waste. A large labeled dataset of waste images is created to train the system,
enabling accurate and efficient waste segregation for improved recycling and sustainability.

∗ State Prediction and Energy Disaggregation using LSTM-transformer Model for Sustainable
Manufacturing. Focusing on predicting the next-second state based on previous time states with an accuracy
exceeding 90 percent, involving six devices, data collection and analysis were independently managed for two related
projects. This project is based on the first phase of data collection, where the analyzed data was used to differentiate
time states at various timestamps and prepared for database storage.
Additive Manufacturing Printing Projects. 2022 & 2024

∗ Additive Manufacturing of Aerospace Heat Exchanger. With extensive experience in metal printing,
particularly with aluminum, titanium, and stainless steel, currently focused on researching stainless steel 316 (SS316),
Haynes 282, and AlSi10Mg materials. DOI:https://arcs.center/consortium-for-high-volume-additive-manufacturingof-aerospace-heat-exchanger-and-talent-development/

∗ In 2022, this project involved six months of using a metal 3D printer, successfully achieving the printing objectives and
contributing to the fabrication of Ti6Al4V alloy scaffolds.
